# Garage lighting
#
# We just have a basic dimmable smart bulb, and a motion sensor. The only thing extra about this 
# automation is that it uses "transition" to slowly dim the bulb so if someone is beyond the motion
# sensor's reach for a while, they have some time to "trip" it again before they have to stumble 
# around in the dark
