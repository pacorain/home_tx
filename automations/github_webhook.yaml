# GitHub Webhook
#
# Runs the Git Pull addon whenever we get a webhook from GitHub. Unfortunately, when Home Assistant
# processes webhooks in automations, only the request body and query string is available.
# https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/d3f67c3841a586eefe8b69beb85e4a3f6f1755bf/homeassistant/components/automation/webhook.py#L27-L34
# This means that I have to put the webhook ID into a secret as opposed to exposing the webhook ID
# and using GitHub's functionality to include a secret. (I'm also not sure if I would be able to 
# validate the secret since it is encrypted based on the body.)
