# Nursery motion lighting
#
# Right now, the baby is in her bassinet, so whenever we walk in the nursery at night we want the 
# light to automatically turn on (especially since our hands will probably be full of baby)
#
# One quirk about the dimmer module I'm using is that it has its own fading settings. For some
# it sends a new brightness every step of the fade, so when light.turn_off is called, OpenZWave
# immediately gets a bunch of signals that the light has been turned back on at decreasing 
# brightnesses. It often gets confused, and the light suddenly comes back on at a lesser 
# brightness.
#
# I haven't found a workaround, but I've filed https://github.com/pacorain/home/issues/10 in the
# meantime
