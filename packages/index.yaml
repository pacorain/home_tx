# Package Index
#
# I have decided to organize my YAML functionality into actual "packages". Whenever a package is
# added, it needs to be listed here. To learn more about what each package does, I will include 
# more info to the package.yaml file, as well as potentially a README.md file.
#
# See https://github.com/pacorain/home/issues/13

# Legacy package keeps old organization method functioning for while
