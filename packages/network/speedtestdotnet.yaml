# When a scan is run, it grabs my ping, download speed, and upload speed for my internet 
# connection. One caveat to be aware of is that this will be run from my Home Assistant server.
# which is currently:
#
# HassOS on RPi4 -> TPLink 16-Port Gigabit Switch -> Amplifi Router -> DOCSIS 3.0 Modem
#
# Each of these nodes can have limitations that affect my internet speed.
