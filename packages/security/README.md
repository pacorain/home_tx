# Security Package

This package contains all of the integrations for my security system. I use the Home Assitant 
[manual alarm](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/manual/), which requires you to define
what arms, disarms, and triggers the alarm manually using automations.

I'm considering, at some point, making my own custom integration for security.

## TODO

I want to document how my security system is set up, but for now my priority is to get it
working a little better so that it's actually usable.
