# Discord Webhooks - posts to a specific channel in a Discord server.
#
# This just uses the REST platform to utilize Discord's webhook API.
# I think eventually I'd like to make a custom component that allows me
# to add embeds, have custom icons for the profile picture, change the
# username, etc. But for now, this is the simplest solution.
